        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Last updated: December 26, 2025</p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the <strong>ShazamMedia</strong>
            application (the "App") operated by us.</p>

        <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the
            terms, then you may not access the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>ShazamMedia is an anime identification tool that allows users to recognize anime scenes from images or video
            frames ("Service"). The App relies on <strong>Trace.moe</strong> for image recognition and
            <strong>AniList</strong> for anime information.</p>

        <h2>2. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. ShazamMedia makes no representations or
            warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the
            identification results. We do not guarantee that the Service will function without interruption or errors.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Content Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>You acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Results are generated by automated systems (Trace.moe) and may not always be
                100% accurate.</li>
            <li><strong>Mature Content:</strong> Some search results may unintentionally reference mature,
                adult-oriented, or age-restricted works. ShazamMedia does not host, create, or control this content and
                simply displays metadata returned by <strong>AniList</strong> and <strong>Trace.moe</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Links:</strong> The App may contain links to third-party websites (like AniList for
                full details) that are not owned or controlled by ShazamMedia. We have no control over, and assume no
                responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>By using the App, you agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You represent that you have the right to submit any images or content you use for search purposes.</li>
            <li>You will not use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for your conduct and any data, text, information, usernames, graphics,
                images, photos, profiles, audio, and video clips that you submit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>ShazamMedia is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any anime studios, publishers, licensors, or
            the creators of the underlying identification technologies (Trace.moe, AniList). All trademarks, service
            marks, and trade names are the property of their respective owners.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <div class="disclaimer">
            <p>In no event shall ShazamMedia, nor its developers, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
                consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, or other
                intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App;
                (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the App; or (iii) any content obtained from the App.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing to
            access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
        </p>
